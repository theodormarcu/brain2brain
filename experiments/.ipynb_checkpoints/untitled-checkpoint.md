# Notes from Experiments

* Tried running NNs using book examples and a basic TCN on one conversation. Results were not great, because the NN could not generalize. Main hypothesis: too little data. (December 9, 2019)
    * Next steps: Train on several hours worth of data. 
    * Look into other TCN architectures. 
    * Look into BERT and GPT-2.
